# StudyGen-AI
An AI-powered PDF study assistant built with Flask, RAG, and Google Gemini API. Upload any PDF to get summaries, practice quizzes, flashcards, and contextual Q&amp;A chat.


# 📚 StudyGen AI – AI PDF Study Assistant

## About the Project

StudyGen AI is a web application developed as a college AIML project to make studying from PDF documents easier and more interactive.

Instead of reading long notes or textbooks manually, users can upload a PDF and interact with it using Artificial Intelligence. The application extracts the text from the uploaded document and uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with the Google Gemini API to answer questions, generate summaries, create quizzes, and prepare flashcards.

The main goal of this project is to help students save time while improving their learning experience through AI.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.10 or above)
- Visual Studio Code
- Git (optional)
- Google Gemini API Key

---

## Recommended VS Code Extensions

- Python (Microsoft)
- Pylance
- DotENV
- Markdown All in One

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Project

Open the **StudyGen_AI** folder in Visual Studio Code.

---

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Open the terminal and run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment:

**Windows**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create or edit the `.env` file in the project folder.

```env
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

To get your Gemini API Key:

1. Visit Google AI Studio.
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Create a new API Key.
4. Copy and paste it into the `.env` file.

---

### Step 5: Verify the Setup

Run:

```bash
python test_rag.py
```

If everything is configured correctly, the API connection will be verified.

---

### Step 6: Start the Application

Run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Now upload a PDF and start using the application.

---

## How It Works

1. Upload a PDF document.
2. The application extracts the text.
3. The content is stored in a ChromaDB vector database.
4. Relevant information is retrieved using RAG.
5. Google Gemini generates answers based on the retrieved content.
6. Users can generate summaries, quizzes, and flashcards from the same PDF.

---

## Future Improvements

- User Login System
- Multiple PDF Support
- Voice-based Question Answering
- Multi-language Support
- Cloud Storage Integration
- Progress Tracking Dashboard

---

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how Generative AI can improve learning by transforming static PDF documents into an interactive study assistant. It helps students quickly understand concepts, revise important topics, and test their knowledge using AI-generated content.

---
## Environment Variables

For security reasons, this repository does **not** include the `.env` file. Sensitive information such as API keys and secret keys should never be committed to GitHub.

Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add the following:

```env
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### Getting a Google Gemini API Key

1. Visit **Google AI Studio**.
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **Create API Key**.
4. Copy the generated API key.
5. Paste it into your `.env` file.

## Files Ignored by Git

This project uses a `.gitignore` file to exclude files and folders that should not be uploaded to GitHub.

The following are ignored:

- `.env` – Stores API keys and other sensitive environment variables.
- `venv/` – Python virtual environment.
- `.venv/` – Alternative virtual environment folder.
- `__pycache__/` – Python cache files generated automatically.
- `*.pyc` – Compiled Python files.
- `chroma_store/` – Local ChromaDB vector database generated at runtime.
- `uploads/` – User-uploaded PDF files generated during application usage.

These files and folders are created automatically during development or contain sensitive information, so they are intentionally excluded from version control.

> **Note:** After cloning this repository, create your own `.env` file and install the required dependencies before running the project.
